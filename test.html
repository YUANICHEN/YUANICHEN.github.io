    Hello everyone. I'm Nina Chen. This is my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; website.
    <h1>My Trip Around the USA on a Segway
Segway'n USA</h1>
<h6>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</h6>

<h3>August 20, 2012</h3>
    
<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Truth or Consequences, NM, Why, AZ </p>

I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
I definitely won't be passing any cars.

My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
